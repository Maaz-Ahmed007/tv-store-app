>> Changes to Make

I will redesign this app in a mobile version which can also be controlled from pc but both designs will differ and have different pages, functionality and controls.

In mobile we will create small pages that can be backed or closed easily and create new forms for mobile versions and here we will also create new type of buttons that will appear on top z index and easy to navigate on mobile for creating entries. We will also create tables with new looks over each table will be add new button, search input and all the options we will need, we will use easy khata app for design inspiration.

We will create expenses same way as in the mining company software.
We will manage products and along with them on same page we will handle stocks.
We will handle sales where we can also handle customers that buys the store products.
We will make passwordless authentication system and admin page where I will register emails and users will be able to log into their accounts directly with email no password required.
