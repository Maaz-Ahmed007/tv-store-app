Project TV Store

First tackle database models for each like customers, sales, expenses and products. Then create validations schema using zod and create server actions to do all kinds of actions we will need even the updating of stock and sales to make sure all needed functionality is added and at last we will tackle the front end of the website to make it look as we want to and add some sort of authentication with no registeration and forget password functionality as well as settings where user can edit few things.
